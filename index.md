## **üåü Project Overview**
This project conducts a comparative analysis of **inflation** and **economic trends** in the **United States** and **Germany** from **2009 to 2023**, focusing on the impact of political leadership changes in each country.  

### Key Economic Indicators:
- **üìà Consumer Price Index (CPI)**  
- **üíπ Inflation (Annual %)**  
- **üí∞ GDP (Current US$)**  
- **üìä GDP Deflator (2010 base year)**  

We examine these metrics under **U.S. presidencies** (Obama, Trump, Biden) and **German chancellorships** (Merkel, Scholz) to identify patterns and insights into leadership-driven economic changes.

## **‚ùì Research Questions**
1. **How do inflation trends (CPI and GDP deflator) differ across different political leadership tenures in the U.S. and Germany?**  
2. **How do changes in economic indicators like GDP reflect shifts in leadership policies and their economic impact?**  
3. **What are the similarities and differences in inflation trends between the U.S. and Germany during the studied political periods?**

## **üìö Data Sources**

- **Consumer Price Index (CPI):** Measures changes in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services.  
- **Inflation (Annual %, CPI-based):** Tracks annual percentage changes in the cost of goods and services.  
- **Inflation (GDP Deflator):** Measures economy-wide inflation via price changes in all goods and services.  
- **GDP (Current US$):** Tracks the total economic output at current market prices.  
- **GDP Deflator (2010 = 100):** Measures economy-wide inflation relative to a 2010 base year.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Methodology**

- **Data Slicing:** Extracted data for 2009-2023 for the U.S. and Germany.  
- **Cleaning:** Handled missing or inconsistent data using interpolation.  
- **Indexing:** Reformatted datasets to enable easier analysis and visualization.  
- **Base-Year Normalization:** Addressed discrepancies in base years for GDP deflator metrics.

## **üìä Analysis and Visualization**

We analyzed the data across the political tenures:  
- **U.S. Presidencies:** Obama (2009-2017), Trump (2017-2021), Biden (2021-2023)  
- **German Chancellorships:** Merkel (2009-2021), Scholz (2021-2023)

### Key Steps:
- **Shaded Graphs:** Highlighted political terms to correlate economic trends with leadership changes.  
- **Multi-Metric Plots:** Combined CPI and inflation data for a holistic view.  
- **Cross-Country Comparisons:** Analyzed similarities and differences between the U.S. and Germany.

## **üìà Key Visualizations for both countries**
1. **CPI Trends:** Evolution of consumer price indices in both countries.  
2. **Inflation (Annual %, CPI):** Fluctuations in annual consumer inflation rates.  
3. **CPI vs. Inflation:** Correlation between CPI levels and inflation rates.  
4. **Inflation (GDP Deflator):** Broader economic inflation trends.  
5. **GDP (Current US$):** Economic growth trends in both nations.  
6. **GDP Deflator:** Price level changes relative to the 2010 base year.  
7. **Inflation Comparison (GDP Deflator vs CPI):** Contrasting inflation measures over time.

## **üìä Conclusion and Cross-Country Comparison**

- **As expected USA shows a consistently higher and faster-growing CPI than Germany, indicating more significant cumulative price increases over the years. Germany's CPI remains more stable, reflecting controlled inflationary pressures compared to the USA.

- **Inflation Rates:
Both countries experience a sharp increase in inflation post-2020, likely due to global economic disruptions (e.g., pandemic recovery, supply chain issues, energy crises). Inflation rates in both countries begin to stabilize by 2023, though Germany shows lower rates than the USA.
Overall, the plotted data aligned with our hypothesis, although there might be many more external factors that impacted the GDP, Inflation and CPI trends, which we did not mention in our data analysis.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations**

- **Data Scope:** Analysis focused on **2009-2023**, limiting insights into long-term trends.  
- **External Events:** Factors like the **COVID-19 pandemic** may have disproportionately influenced trends during specific periods.  
- **Comparison Challenges:** Discrepancies in GDP deflator metrics were normalized but required careful contextual interpretation.
